About the board:

I wanted a corne variant that had a dedicated key for alt on the left hand side, and a stagger that naturally fits your fingers when placed on the homerow.

Features:

Uses ZMK for firmware, meaning it is wireless and runs on a battery.
The case, which can be found and downloaded here https://www.printables.com/model/1103238-capricorne-case features a Magsafe placement guide.
I bought some magsafe rings on AliExpress and attached them to the case, this allows for the use of magsafe desk stands for tenting.
